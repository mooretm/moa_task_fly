## Description
This application provides a set of arrow controls useful for measuring participant perception using the method of adjustment. NOTE: the application <strong>DOES NOT</strong> use an adaptive staircase procedure. The Session dialog provides several customizations to create trains of stimuli using a single, brief, imported .wav file. 

"OTF" in the title stands for "on the fly", in reference to the application's ability to create novel stimuli based on a single instance from a provided .wav file.

If you have a series of .wav files (i.e., you do not want to use the application to create stimuli), please use the regular version of the MOA Task Controller that expects a .wav file for each stimulus.

## Session Window

### Exporting a stimulus
This task controller can export a stimulus, based on the values entered in the Session Window's "Stimulus Options" section. Simply enter the desired stimulus values, then click the "Export as .wav" button. A .wav file will be written to the running app's directory. 

- NOTE: A new stimulus will be created when starting the session, also based on the values entered in the Session Window's "Stimulus Options" section; however, any values that are randomly applied, for example jitter, will differ between the exported .wav file and the newly-generated stimulus on session start.
